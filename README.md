======

Augustus is a single page note taking web application built with elegance in mind.
The app mimics the functionalities of Evernote, the design is my own.  
I built this over the course of 10 days from February 26 to March 8 2019 to improve my web development skills.

Technologies
---
Augustus makes use of the Ruby on Rails React Redux stack with PostgreSQL.  
And the React Quill Api to handle rich text editing.  

Design
---
Augustus was designed with a simple theme.  Clear and bold, just like Augustus Caesar.
The custom fonts and logos make it clear to the user what each component is responsible for.
This allows the user to focus on their writing. 

Features
---
* Encrypted user authentication for signup, login, and logout
* Protected and Authorized routes for all parts of the app
* Full Create Update Read and Destroy (CRUD) capabilities for Notes and Notebooks 
* Rich text editing, photo upload, and video linking for notes
* Modals to indicate to the user which features are to be built in the future
